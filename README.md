## Overview
This is a job-listing challenge that is to return a filtered UI based on the input tabs

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process
This project was the challenge I needed after further learnings on array methods, especially data transformational methods.

I appreciated the process of thinking through the problem to come up with the right solution. So every time the code does not work, I am revisiting my problem statement and implementation.

Also, I highly appreciated reaching out to the developer community in my school at road blockers, after numerous futile attempts at it, and getting insights on how others understood the code and figured errors or made recommendations when and where necessary. In addition to this, reading up articles in search for methods I know existed and seeing how to manipulate them for the desired outcome is a treasured experience through this project.

I enjoyed the thrill and relief of every line of code that worked.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

- Large screen-first workflow
- Structured with HTML 5, 
- Styled with CSS custom properties
- Implemented functions with vanilla Javascript
- Adjusted functions and style to reflect desired outcome

### Continued development

I want to pick more projects so I can learn through practice of all I have learnt and I'm learning teoretically
